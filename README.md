# Advent of Code 2023

These are my [advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions. I'm using python 3.11.6, and so far I have not used any packages other than pytest for testing and black for formatting.
If I use any additional packages, I will update this README.

There is a directory for each day which contains part 1 and part 2.

Other than that, it should be pretty self explanatory.
